### THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA VISUALIZATION

Before the formal written language, there were pictures. Primitive drawings shared ideas, plans, and history.

When something gets too difficult to understand, sometimes resorting to this uncomplicated language of data visualization simplifies everything to a concept you can grasp. Data visualization puts complex data into a graphical format, allowing you to more easily understand the state of your business and identify patterns to bolster your successful strategies.

In the early days of data visualization, the best and only way to visualize your data existed within Excel’s capabilities. You’d start with a handy spreadsheet and slowly and painstakingly create a simplified graphic to help convey a message or understand a business trend.

It used to be the best tool out there until data evolved to a point that Excel couldn’t handle its size, and professionals needed more complex visualizations than a pie, line, or bar graph.

This is when the modern era of data visualization began. It took off at a steady pace and has only gained steam in the last few years.

Without a doubt, data visualization is a crucial tool in today’s data-focused business world. Here are nine ways they help you and reasons why you can’t afford to skip out on the trend:

1. ABSORB INFORMATION QUICKLY.
A picture is worth a thousand words. Or, in this case, a picture is worth thousands of lines of data. As data volume inevitably increases, visualization manages influxes of new information and makes it easy to find trends.

2. UNDERSTAND YOUR NEXT STEPS.
From these visual trends, you can easily understand your best next steps with less time and energy dedicated to data analysis. You can save hours of time by looking at the big picture instead of a thousand puzzle pieces.

3. CONNECT THE DOTS.
Data visualization doesn’t just show patterns and trends. It also brings important but subtle correlations and relationships between business conditions into focus.

4. HOLD YOUR AUDIENCE’S INTERESTS LONGER.
Graphics built with your data replay a message quickly, before you lose interest. As people now have an attention span shorter than that of goldfish [Microsoft], keeping interest is a crucial goal when sharing insights.

5. KICK THE NEED FOR DATA SCIENTISTS.
Data visualization makes data more accessible and less confusing. Just years ago, the only professionals who could understand company data worked in the IT department. Now, finance, sales, and marketing teams not only have an avid interest in what they’re data tells them, but they have the means to actually go after the answers.

6. SHARE YOUR INSIGHTS WITH EVERYONE.
It makes data more shareable. Visualizations can be distributed among teams easily, and your teams will be much more receptive to an attractive visual than a massive Excel spreadsheet.

7. FIND THE OUTLIERS.
Data visualization quickly reveals the outliers in your data. As outliers tend to drag down data averages in the wrong direction, it’s crucial to find and eliminate them from your analysis when they skew the results. Graphics quickly shed light on them, allowing you to understand why they’re there and ignore them when necessary.

8. MEMORIZE THE IMPORTANT INSIGHTS.
Visuals help commit important concepts to memory. It’s easier to remember and memorize a concept if we have a graphic to focus on, not just words or line items.

9. ACT ON YOUR FINDINGS QUICKLY.
Most importantly, data visualization allows you to make decisions faster. Using them, you can review your strategies quickly and make updates efficiently, helping you achieve success with fewer mistakes and greater speed.

Thus, I collected some examples from the library for future reference.
